# Java based Webserver
A multi-threaded file-based web server with thread pooling implemented in java.

It is based the sample from [link](https://www.shubhsblog.com/programming/multithreaded-webserver-java.html)
 
### Features added by Denny Ma:
* Thread pooling by leveraging Java Executor [link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html)
* Add proper HTTP/1.1keep-alive behavior based on the http-client's capabilities exposed through its request headers.
* Load web server config properties from config.properties
* Log4j to manage the logging
* Maven based project which manage the dependencies more easily
* Junit for unit tests
* Support SVG file type
* Support http request for static file with parameters (won't process parameters for now)

### Instructions on how to run the web server
* Create a folder for the web server
* Copy javawebserver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar to the folder
* Optional: create your own log4j2.xml (refer to the one in src/resources/) and config.properties (refer to the one in config folder)

Assume you have your own log4j2.xml and it is Mac OS or linux. 
Run sudo java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml -jar javawebserver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
otherwise
Run sudo java -jar javawebserver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

### Todo list:
* Add the code coverage for the project
* Support most popular file types
* Process the parameters in the query for the static file
